# TrivAI Gaming Platform - Development Workflow

## üöÄ Overview

This document outlines the development workflow, Git practices, and collaboration processes for the TrivAI gaming platform project.

## üìã Development Principles

### Core Values
- **Quality First**: Every step must be tested and verified
- **Incremental Progress**: Small, frequent commits with clear progress
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation updated with each change
- **Transparency**: Open source development with clear communication
- **Collaboration**: Code reviews and pair programming when beneficial

### Development Philosophy
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Security-First**: Security considerations in every step
- **Performance-Oriented**: Gaming requires optimal performance
- **Accessibility**: Inclusive design from the start

## üå≥ Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy
We use a **Git Flow** inspired approach adapted for our project needs:

```
main
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ develop
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/step-1-1-project-initialization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/step-1-2-documentation-setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/step-2-1-design-system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hotfix/critical-bug-fix
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ release/v0.2.0-landing-page
```

### Branch Types

#### 1. Main Branch
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- **Protection**: Protected branch with required reviews
- **Naming**: `main`
- **Lifecycle**: Permanent
- **Deploy**: Automatic deployment to production

#### 2. Develop Branch
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for features
- **Protection**: Protected branch with required reviews
- **Naming**: `develop`
- **Lifecycle**: Permanent
- **Deploy**: Automatic deployment to staging

#### 3. Feature Branches
- **Purpose**: Individual step implementation
- **Protection**: None (but require PR for merge)
- **Naming**: `feature/step-X-Y-description`
- **Lifecycle**: Temporary (deleted after merge)
- **Deploy**: Manual deployment to preview environments

#### 4. Release Branches
- **Purpose**: Phase completion preparation
- **Protection**: Protected branch with required reviews
- **Naming**: `release/vX.Y.Z-phase-name`
- **Lifecycle**: Temporary (deleted after merge)
- **Deploy**: Staging deployment for final testing

#### 5. Hotfix Branches
- **Purpose**: Critical production fixes
- **Protection**: None (but require urgent review)
- **Naming**: `hotfix/critical-issue-description`
- **Lifecycle**: Temporary (deleted after merge)
- **Deploy**: Direct to production after review

### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/step-1-1-project-initialization
feature/step-2-3-landing-page-features
bugfix/lobby-connection-issue
hotfix/security-vulnerability
release/v0.2.0-landing-page
```

## üîÑ Step-by-Step Development Process

### For Each Project Step

#### 1. Pre-Development (Planning)
```bash
# 1. Start from develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/step-X-Y-description

# 3. Update project documentation
# - Mark step as "In Progress" in PROJECT_PLAN.md
# - Create detailed task breakdown if needed
```

#### 2. Development Phase
```bash
# 1. Implement the step requirements
# - Write tests first (TDD approach)
# - Implement functionality
# - Ensure code quality (linting, formatting)

# 2. Regular commits during development
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement initial structure for step X.Y

- Add basic component structure
- Set up test framework
- Configure development environment

Refs: #issue-number"

# 3. Push regularly for backup
git push origin feature/step-X-Y-description
```

#### 3. Testing & Quality Assurance
```bash
# 1. Run all tests
pnpm test

# 2. Run linting and formatting
pnpm lint
pnpm format

# 3. Check TypeScript compilation
pnpm type-check

# 4. Test in different environments
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test:integration
```

#### 4. Documentation Update
```bash
# Update relevant documentation
# - Update CHANGELOG.md with changes
# - Update README.md if needed
# - Update technical documentation
# - Mark step as completed in PROJECT_PLAN.md

git add docs/
git commit -m "docs: update documentation for step X.Y completion

- Mark step X.Y as completed in PROJECT_PLAN.md
- Update CHANGELOG.md with new features
- Add technical documentation for new components

Refs: #issue-number"
```

#### 5. Pull Request Creation
```bash
# 1. Push final changes
git push origin feature/step-X-Y-description

# 2. Create PR via GitHub
# - Use PR template
# - Assign reviewers
# - Link to relevant issues
# - Add detailed description
```

#### 6. Code Review Process
- **Self-Review**: Review your own code first
- **Peer Review**: At least one reviewer (or self if solo)
- **Testing**: Reviewer tests the functionality
- **Documentation**: Verify documentation is updated
- **Approval**: Approve and merge after all checks pass

#### 7. Merge and Cleanup
```bash
# 1. Merge via GitHub (squash and merge)
# 2. Delete feature branch
# 3. Update local repository
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git branch -d feature/step-X-Y-description
```

#### 8. Post-Merge Activities
```bash
# 1. Tag if step completes a phase
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Phase 2: Landing Page Development Complete"
git push origin v0.2.0

# 2. Deploy to staging/production if needed
# 3. Update project tracking
# 4. Plan next step
```
